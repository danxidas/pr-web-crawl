I have modified the original python script with the following tweaks:

Changed search engine to Bing.   Google always redirects everything of HTTPS and I wanted a clear text HTTP search.
Added images to the downloads.  
Added a few other seed sites.
Ignored SSL errors.  (still need to test if SSL MITM will work with this)
Removed most 'bad' categories from the url blacklist.   I'm actually hoping to see if this host will download something malicious.
